# AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools were used during development as assistants to speed up research and implementation.

They were mainly used for:

- Brainstorming component structure
- Reviewing multi-step form patterns
- Generating small snippets for:
  - Zod validation schemas
  - Context API setup
  - MUI styling patterns
- Suggesting performance optimization ideas
- Reviewing documentation clarity

Example prompts used:

- "How to structure a multi-step form using React Hook Form?"
- "Best way to prevent unnecessary re-renders with Context API?"
- "How to dynamically highlight cheapest and fastest items in a list?"
- "What are practical bundle optimization strategies in Vite?"

All architectural decisions, debugging, integration, and final adjustments were done manually.

AI was used as a development aid, not as an automated project generator.
